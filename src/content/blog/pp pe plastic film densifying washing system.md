## Introduce

### Customizable Plastic Film Washing Line Solutions
Our standard plastic film washing line, with input capacities ranging from 500kg/h to 3000kg/h, can be customized to accommodate larger recycling needs. We offer tailored setups for clients requiring higher capacity, integrating additional machinery to ensure we meet their unique demands.

### Environmentally Conscious Recycling
Our turnkey solution effectively recycles loose or baled plastic film into plastic pellets, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of plastic waste. By recycling plastic film instead of sending it to landfills, we contribute to a healthier environment for future generations.

### Sustainability and Exceptional Customer Service
We take pride in our sustainability efforts and exceptional customer service. Our expert team is ready to assist you in finding the right solution for your recycling needs. Contact us today to learn more about our turnkey solutions and how we can help you positively impact the environment while achieving healthy profit margins.

## Working Principle
The entire plastic film washing line is controlled via a central electric control panel and cabinet. Each piece of equipment is connected using conveyors.

### Plastic Shredder Machine:
Since long pieces of plastic film tend to tangle (imagine saran wrap) and clog conveyors and rotary-based machines, the first step is to cut the plastic film into smaller pieces using a plastic shredder machine. The resulting plastic pieces from the shredder are around 1-5 inches in size.

### Plastic Granulator:
The plastic granulator cuts the plastic film into even smaller pieces, approximately 10-20mm in size. With water constantly injected into the cutting chamber, our wet granulation process also "pre-treats" and partially cleans the plastic film before moving onto the next machine.

### Friction Washer:
Our high-power friction washers spin at nearly 1,000 rotations per minute. As the PP/PE films enter the friction washer, they rub against each other at high speeds, removing stubborn contamination. At the same time, any paper and cardboard are broken down into fibers and removed. While one friction washer is standard, various washing plants have requested a secondary friction washer to ensure thorough cleanliness.

### Sink Float Separation Tank:
Using water as a medium, materials that float are separated from materials that sink. In the case of plastic film recycling, PP and PE films will float while heavier contaminants such as dirt, sand, glass, metals, and other plastics will sink. A screw conveyor at the bottom of the sink float separation tank removes the contaminants. While separation is one aspect of this apparatus, a secondary function is to further clean the plastic film.

### Centrifugal Dewatering Machine:
The first step in the drying process, our centrifugal dewatering machine uses centrifugal force to remove a large portion of water from the plastic film before moving forward onto the thermal dryers. As thermal dryers use heat to dehydrate water, they require more energy consumption during operation. Hence, the use of the dewatering machine is beneficial in saving long-run operating costs.

### Screw Press Dewatering Machine:
An optional piece of equipment, the screw-press dewatering machine is a more advanced version of the standard dewatering machine. Instead of using centrifugal force to remove water from the plastic film, the screw press squeezes the water out via high pressure. This machine can actually take the place of both the dewatering machine and thermal dryers.

### Thermal Dryer + Cyclone Separator:
The clean plastic film is vacuumed out of the dewatering machine and into the thermal dryer system, where it travels down a series of stainless steel tubes, mixing with hot air. The remaining moisture is dehydrated in this process, which ends with a cyclone separator. The cyclone separator allows the plastic film to mix with a fresh stream of cold air, preparing it for storage into the product silo. The cyclone separator is also effective in removing fines and dust.

### Product Silo:
A storage tank for the clean, dry pieces of plastic film.

### Plastic Pelletizing Machine:
The final step in plastic film recycling, and perhaps the most important, the clean film needs to be processed into plastic pellets before it can be used in production. To accomplish this, we offer a specialized plastic film water ring pelletizer system that produces beautiful, round plastic pellets.
