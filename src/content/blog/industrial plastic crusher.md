cardImageAlt: "The image shows an industrial plastic crusher machine. This type of equipment is typically used in recycling processes to break down plastic materials into smaller pieces, which can then be processed further. The machine features a robust design with a green and yellow cylindrical component—likely the crushing mechanism—connected to a white and gray housing that contains the mechanical parts and possibly the control system. The entire assembly is mounted on a sturdy green base, ensuring stability during operation."

Our standard heavy-duty plastic granulators, also known as plastic crushers, are essential machines in the plastic recycling industry. These specially designed granulators are extremely durable and have the unique ability to quickly and efficiently cut various plastic streams into small, uniform flakes or regrinds.

As one of our most popular plastic recycling machines, these granulators are integrated into many of our complete recycling solutions, including our popular PET bottle washing lines and plastic film recycling lines.

## Working Principle

At the heart of our plastic granulator is an open rotor mounted with heavy-duty knives arranged in either a double-scissor cut or V-shape array, based on your requirements. As the rotor spins at high speeds, the rotor knives come into contact with stationary knives mounted within the cutting chamber, continuously cutting the material until it is small enough to pass through a screen filter.
Our filter screens generally range from 10mm to 100mm but can be customized according to your requirements.
Our standard plastic granulator houses 12 rotor knives and 3 stationary knives. All knives are made of ultra-durable D2 (equivalent to SDK11) high-carbon, high-chromium steel, ensuring the longest usage times before requiring sharpening. All knives are easily adjustable with hydraulic-assisted access to the cutting chamber.

## Applications
This general-purpose plastic granulator can be used in a variety of plastic recycling applications, including but not limited to grinding plastic bottles, films, and various small rigid plastics.
For added convenience, we also offer wet plastic granulator machines with additional rubber sealing and a water inlet hose attached, allowing a constant stream of water to be sprayed while the plastic is being cut. This helps clean the plastic scrap while keeping the blades cool during operation.

## Plastic Granulators VS Shredder Machines
Plastic recycling granulators are high-speed machines capable of cutting smaller-sized, thin plastics into flakes and fine regrinds. Due to their fast rotation speeds, operators must be careful not to have hard contaminants such as metals or rocks in the input stream, as metals like nuts and bolts can easily damage the machine, including chipping the cutting blades. To ensure metals are not present, we suggest adding a magnetic suspension separator above the conveyor system.
Plastic shredder machines, while also used for size reduction in plastic recycling, are low-speed, more robust machines capable of cutting large pieces of plastic. They are also more forgiving with contaminants. Therefore, plastic shredders are often used to precut large pieces of plastic into smaller sizes suitable for use in plastic granulators. The granulator then further reduces the plastic into flakes or regrinds.
