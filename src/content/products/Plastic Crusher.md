    Our standard heavy-duty plastic granulator machines, sometimes called plastic crushers, are essential machines in the plastic recycling industry. These specially designed granulators are extremely durable and have the unique ability to quickly and efficiently cut various plastic streams into small uniform flakes or regrinds.

  imgAlt: "The image shows a plastic granulator machine. It is used to recycle plastic waste by breaking it down into smaller pieces. The machine has a hopper on top where the plastic waste is fed, and a chamber below where the plastic is shredded. The shredded plastic is then expelled from the machine through a discharge chute."

  - title: "Working Principle"
    subTitle: "At the core of our plastic granulator machine is an open rotor mounted with heavy-duty knives in either a double-scissor cut or v-shape array based on your requirements. As the rotor is spun at high speeds, the rotor knives come in contact with stationary knives that are mounted within the cutting chamber. The material is continuously cut until they are small enough to pass through a screen filter.<br>

Generally speaking, our filter screens are between 10mm to 100mm but can be customized according to your requirements.<br>

Our standard plastic granulator houses 12 rotor and 3 stationary knives. All knives use only ultra durable D2 (equivalent to SDK11) high-carbon, high-chromium steel which ensures the longest usage times before requiring sharpening. All knives are easily adjustable with hydraulic assisted access to the cutting chamber."
  - title: "Applications"
    subTitle: "This general purpose plastic granulator can be used in a variety of applications for plastic recycling including but not limited to grinding plastic bottles, films, and a variety of small rigid plastics.<br>

For added convenience, we also offer wet plastic granulator machines that have additional rubber sealing and water inlet hose attached allowing a constant stream of water to be sprayed while the plastic is being cut. This helps clean the plastic scrap while keeping the blades cool during operation."
